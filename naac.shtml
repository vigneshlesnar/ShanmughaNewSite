                                    <p>
                                        The University Grants Commission (UGC), India has made a policy decision to direct all Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) to establish Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) and to provide seed financial assistance for the same. It has also issued
                                        Guidelines for the establishment and monitoring of IQACs. Maintaining the momentum of quality consciousness is crucial in HEIs. IQAC, an internal quality assurance mechanism of the institution, is conceived as a
                                        mechanism to build and ensure a quality culture at the institutional level. Every HEI should have an internal quality assurance system, with appropriate structure and processes, and with enough flexibility to meet
                                        the diverse needs of the stakeholders. The IQAC is meant for planning, guiding and monitoring Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Enhancement (QE) activities of the HEIs. The IQAC may channelize and systematize the
                                        efforts and measures of an institution towards academic excellence. It should not be yet another hierarchical structure or record-keeping exercise in the institution; it would be a facilitative and participative
                                        organ of the institution. The IQAC should become a driving force for ushering in quality by working out intervention strategies to remove deficiencies and enhance quality.
                                        <br><br> STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF IQAC:
                                        <br><br> According to the UGC Guidelines, the IQAC shall be constituted under the chairmanship of the head of the HEI. He/She may be assisted by a Coordinator who shall be a senior faculty member. The IQAC shall
