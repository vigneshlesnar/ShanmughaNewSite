            <div class="clr10"></div>
            <p>
                A hexapod robot is a mechanical vehicle that walks on six legs. Since a robot can be statically stable on three or more legs, a hexapod robot has a great deal of flexibility in how it can move. If legs become disabled, the robot may still be able to walk. Furthermore, not all of the robot’s legs are needed for stability; other legs are free to reach new foot placements or manipulate a payload.Many hexapod robots are biologically inspired Hexapoda locomotion. Hexapods may be used to test biological theories about insect locomotion, motor control, and neurobiology.Here Hexapods are used for monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. They can act as a pack or as an individual unit to serve their purpose. They have the potential to be a new frontier in Security Systems with their ability to perform secret and unobtrusive Surveillance and Reconnaissance on Specific Targets.
