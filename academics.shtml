                  <p>At the outset of academic year, the students’ learning level is assessed through dual measures viz., on the basis of marks scored in +2 examination and in entry level test and in pursuance they are identified as slow and advanced learners. This system helps to formulate a strategy for improving slow learners through special coaching/tutorial sessions to bridge the gap between them and advance learners.</p>
                  <P>After analyzing the learning level from their performance in daily tests and first Internal Assessment Examination, the students are again categorized which encourages them to learn more and prove their involvement in the class room observation. In order to motivate the students continuous trainings are given on communication skills, personality development, time management, seminars and guest lectures are arranged for their benefit. Various workshops with hands-on session both internal and external are arranged for promoting their programming knowledge and skills. The advanced learners are termed as “coordinators” and they actively sharing their knowledge with the slow learners.</P>
                  <P><b>Strategy for Slow Learners:</b></P>
                  <li>The class advisors assess the students’ caliber, analyze the nature of issues faced by them in their academia and motivate them diplomatically to achieve their academic goals.</li>
                  <li>Special/Tutorial classes are arranged for intensified teaching on the difficult units/chapters and clarifying doubts and thereby to improve their performance.</li>
                  <li>The class advisor/mentor critically analyses slow learners’ issues regarding their academy and personal and give suitable counseling.</li>
                  <li>Departments conduct remedial classes and provide course materials to slow learners and other students, who are likely to drop-out due to arrears.</li>
                  <li>Writing assignments on the frequently asked questions in University Examinations are given as the regular task for slow learners and thereby make them to be through with the subjects and the right way of answering the questions in the examination.</li>
                  <li>The advanced learners termed as “coordinators” actively sharing their knowledge with slow learners through peer learning and group study system.</li>

                  <li>Encouraging the advanced learners to be the members of various professional bodies and to organize technical events and club activities through which the leadership qualities in them are spurred up.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging the advance learners to participate in group discussions, technical quizzes and thereby promoting their analytical and problem-solving abilities along with their communication skills.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging the advance learners to accomplish in the research oriented projects to develop a thirst for research orientation and practical knowledge.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging the advance learners to augment their caliber and skills through Programme Specific Training, Value added Courses and interaction with industry experts etc. and thereby to compete the industries scenario requirements.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging the advanced learners to pursue their higher studies in premier institutions by appearing the GATE and IELTS etc.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging the advance learners identified as the Special Interest Group (SIG) found with individual and special talents to actively participate in various competitions and extracurricular activities.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging advanced learners to enroll in MOOC Courses viz., NPTEL, Swayam, edx, Coursera and so on and to actively participate in them.</li>

Our Institution encourages frequent Group Discussion among students, as it is the prime modes of participative learning which helps students to become well acquainted with their subjects and fluency in the presentation. Students also practice the events such as&nbsp;&nbsp; Role-Play/3-Minutes talk/Quiz, other powerful modes of participative learning, so as to become thorough with subjective concepts and effective implementation. Equal importance is paid in encouraging students to participate in Workshops, Seminars, Club and Symposium activities, Design and Coding Contests, Ideathon and Hackathon events and presentation of innovative ideas in the Conferences and publication of articles in leading journals which are the other instances to prove their participative learning. </span></span></span></p>

Students also practice the events such as&nbsp;&nbsp; Role-Play/3-Minutes talk/Quiz, other powerful modes of participative learning, so as to become thorough with subjective concepts and effective implementation. Equal importance is paid in encouraging students to participate in Workshops, Seminars, Club and Symposium activities, Design and Coding Contests, Ideathon and Hackathon events and presentation of innovative ideas in the Conferences and publication of articles in leading journals which are the other instances to prove their participative learning. </span></span></span></p>
