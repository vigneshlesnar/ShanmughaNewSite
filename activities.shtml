However, to gain control of the mind, we must first place it under inner analysis and purify it. Negative thoughts and fears create an imbalance in our nervous system and through this our physical function. This is the cause of many illnesses and sorrows. Clarity of thought, inner Freedom, contentment and a healthy self-confidence are the basis of mental wellbeing.</span></span></span></span></p>

                                The symbol of the National Service Scheme, as appearing on the cover page of this Manual
                                is based on the ' Rath ' wheel of the Konark Sun Temple situated in Orissa. These giant
                                wheels of the Sun Temple portray the cycle of creation, preservation and release, and
                                signify the movement in life across time and space.

                                The design of the symbol, a simplified form of the Sun-chariot wheel primarily depicts
                                movement. The wheel signifies the progressive cycle of life. It stands for continuity as
                                well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social transformation and
                                upliftment.

                                        This club is driven on the basis of – “Neither the technology nor the tools,
                                        it’s only an innovative idea that rules”.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The club enables the students to aware of their inner potential, cultivate
                                        creativity and initiative by proactive academic activities and research. It
                                        promotes enthusiasm among the students by participation of an information and
                                        scientific-based knowledge community. Preparing students to adapt the challenges
                                        of an ever changing world of tomorrow.

                                        The central meaning of innovation relates to renewal or improvement, with
                                        novelty being a consequence of this improvement. It is quite necessary for
                                        people to change the way they make decisions or make choices outside their
                                        norms. On a lower level, innovation can be seen as a change in the thought
                                        process for doing something or useful application of inventions or discoveries.
                                        It may refer to incremental, emergent or radical and revolutionary changes in
                                        thinking, products, processes or organizations.
                                        <br><br>
                                        We provide all sorts of technical assistance and support service to students for
                                        developing new concepts, products and thereby ensure that innovation is a part
                                        of quality education.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Engineering education lacks practical orientation knowledge because of the
                                        absence of opportunities to develop new products during the course. If this can
                                        be solved in the campus, the transformation of a student into a professional
                                        will be explosive.

                                        Developing communication skills within the team can be done easily by
                                        inculcating some basic manners, professional etiquette and keeping an open mind.

                                        It is expected that every member of a team understands and shares relevant
                                        information related to a project. It is also important that they have a clear
                                        picture of their roles and responsibilities with respect to the project and
                                        deliver accordingly. All this is possible only when a team develops and
                                        practices effective communication skills.

                                        The orators program is important because it is critical for young people to
                                        learn to express themselves clearly and precisely. This program increases
                                        self-confidence and keeps from fading into the background. The youngsters are
                                        learning life skills as well as how to present themselves in business
                                        situations. Winning first place not only celebrates a level of accomplished
                                        excellence, Orators club is to develop public speaking skills, confidence and
                                        the unique talents of the participating youths. There will be a competition
                                        involving orators speaking for not less than five minutes and not more than 10
                                        minutes. The participants were judged on eye contact, voice projection, diction,
                                        knowledge of the piece and expression. Rather than sitting back and letting

                                        Students’ readers run in the college library to encourage reading for pleasure.
                                        The prime motive of this reading club initiation was to promote the importance
                                        of English among the students in the college. The students were grouped into
                                        teams and asked to select books on their own interest. They were asked to create
                                        a wall dictionary in their classrooms with the unfamiliar words they come
                                        across. They were asked to notate the important points and indulge in a short
                                        discussion for every week when they meet in the library. When they complete
                                        reading their chosen books they were asked to meet and share their pleasure of
                                        reading.

                                        A local Toastmasters club serves as sponsor and provides a coordinator to
                                        present the program. The individual coordinator attends each meeting, where he
                                        or she will lead most of the presentations and counsel participants. The
                                        coordinator assigns an assistant who can fill in for the coordinator should he
                                        or she be unable to attend a meeting. Meetings generally follow a format similar
                                        to that of a Toastmasters club meeting, including an announced agenda, practice
                                        in parliamentary procedure, and the selection of presiding officers.
