                                The department Master of Computer Science and Engineering was established in the year
                                2012 with an intake of 18 students. The Department has been maintaining high standards
                                in imparting quality education in the challenging field of Computer Science. Highly
                                experienced and dedicated faculty members with minimum M.E / M.Tech qualification impart
                                quality training to students, with solid emphasis on understanding the fundamentals and
                                intricacies of the subjects concerned and subsequently apply them to solve problems. The
                                Department has successfully conducted Technical Symposiums and has arranged a number of
                                seminars and several invited lectures by eminent persons both from academia and
                                industry. The Department has well established lab facilities with advanced software
                                suited to the syllabus prescribed by the University. The Department is adopting a new
                                innovative teaching methodology to meet PEOs (Programme Educational Objectives). It is
                                organizing technical activities in tutorial periods for the enhancement of students
                                skills. It has organized a short-term course for students on ANDROID which will bridge
                                the gap between Academia and Industry. It is also encouraging students to develop the
                                in-house project so that they can meet the industrial requirements, by adopting the
                                standard Project Development Process. Our department has been recognized by IIT Bombay
                                to act as a nodal center for all its distance digital learning process. It has also been
                                bestowed with virtual classroom facilities. We have signed MOU with NPTEL for displaying
                                the lectures by the eminent professors of Computer Science and Engineering. The
                                faculties of the department are the members of the Indian Society for Technical
                                Education (ISTE) and Computer Society of India (CSI). The Department of Computer Science
                                and Engineering has the primary objective of providing world-class education in the
                                field of Computer Science. The department is combining excellence in education and
                                research with reference to the industry. Right from its inception, the Department has
                                been offering phenomenal infrastructural facilities with a variety of computing
                                platforms to professional students to meet the burgeoning demands of the IT industry.
